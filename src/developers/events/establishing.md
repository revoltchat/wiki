# Establishing a connection

To get started, you should have:

- A WebSocket URL, which is found from the API root.
- A valid session or bot token.

You may authenticate in one of two ways:

- Include credentials in the connection URL, see [Query Parameters](#query-parameters).
- Sending an [Authenticate](./protocol.md#authenticate) event to the server.

You should listen out for [Error](./protocol.md#error) events to find out if your credentials are incorrect or if something goes wrong here.

After authenticating, the server will respond with [Authenticated](./protocol.md#authenticated) then it will send a [Ready](./protocol.md#ready) event containing useful data.

The server will now start sending relevant events as they come in.

You should [Ping](./protocol.md#ping) the server every 10 to 30 seconds to prevent your connection being dropped.

Bots receive all events, normal users do not receive UserUpdate events fanned out through servers by default, [read more here](./protocol.md#subscribe).
